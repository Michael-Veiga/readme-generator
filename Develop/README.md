## Installation:

Simply run npm install and npm init inside of the Develop folder.

## Usage

Once the dependencies are installed, you will first want to type "node index.js" into your command line. Then, the terminal should prompt you for your github username. The username is case sensitive, so take extra care to type your input correctly. After, the terminal will proceed to prompt you with a number of questions. Type out your responses as you would with any other readme. The last prompt is a list that contains two links, the first link is a badge that says the page is maintained, while the second link is unmaintained. Select one of the two with your arrow keys and hit enter. You will know if your readme has been successfully created when prompted with the following "Your README has been created!" Simply save the readme to your local folder and commit to your repository.
